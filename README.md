    <h1><code>oxide_control</code>: The <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/dm_control"><code>dm_control</code></a> layer for Rust</h1>
</div>

`oxide_control` is a Rust software stack for
physics-based simulation and Reinforcement Learning environments, using MuJoCo.

This is built up on [rusty_mujoco](https://github.com/rust-control/rusty_mujoco) binding,
and provides a high-level interface similar to [dm_control](https://github.com/google-deepmind/dm_control) in Python.
